# CuTE
Code editor for C++ (compiler g++)

Welcome everybody, this is project for my university subject. Made in Qt Creator ver. 12, with Qt ver. 6.6.1

For compile you need g++ compiler, I dowload it with MinGW.
To build you need windeployqt in Qt directory ("windeployqt6 or windeployqt" "directory CuTE.pro")
